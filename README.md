# Interview Scheduler

This scheduler was built using React Hooks and WebSockets for real-time updates. This project was tested using Jest and Cypress, and components were developed in isolation with StoryBook. Feel free to explore a [live version](https://5e7bf6ef93f0400008f0829b--hardcore-jennings-6a61ff.netlify.com/) of this app.

## Getting Started
